These sketchnotes are no substitute for books' contents, but they help clarify the author's take-home message from each chapter -at least from my point of view-.

I decided to share these sketchnotes in case they could positively impact someone’s learning journey, even slightly. They are the result of my efforts to summarize and visualize the key points of the listed books that I found interesting and useful and especially, controversial. Input and comments on how to enhance these sketchnotes are very welcomed.
