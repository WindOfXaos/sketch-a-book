<i>-Disaster Backlog</i><br>
When people mistake urgency for importance it is the sign of a disaster.

Software provides two values.
- Behavior: is urgent but not always particularly important.
- Architecture: is important but never particularly urgent.

One value is the implementation of the requirements (features), and the other is the flexibility of these features and how easy they are to change when stakeholders change their minds.

And when priorities get mixed up, the developer comes into play, the one who can evaluate the importance of architecture.

- "It is the responsibility of the software 
development team to assert the importance of architecture over the urgency 
of features."
- "Remember, as 
a software developer, you are a stakeholder. You have a stake in the software 
that you need to safeguard. That’s part of your role, and part of your duty. 
And it’s a big part of why you were hired."
- "If architecture comes last, then the system will become ever 
more costly to develop, and eventually change will become practically 
impossible for part or all of the system."
