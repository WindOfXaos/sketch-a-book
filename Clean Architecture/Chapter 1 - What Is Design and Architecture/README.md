<i>-Software Architecture (Design)</i><br>
There is no difference between software architecture and design. Architecture/Design is high-level structure and low-level details. <br> "The low-level details and the high-level structure are all part of the same whole. They form a continuous fabric that defines the shape of the system. You canâ€™t have one without the other."

<i>-Good VS. Bad Architecture</i><br>
A bad architecture or (clean it up later) can delude people -especially overconfident ones- into believing that getting to market first is the objective, like there is no tomorrow. Only to find out that increasing number of costs and staff speeds up bankruptcy instead of productivity and growth. While on the other side a good architecture can multiply productivity with way less effort. Yes, it is all about minimizing the effort. The effort to build and maintain the system. <br> "The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required 
to build and maintain the required system."
