- Software is like science they both work by proving(testing) statements(functions) false unlike mathematics.
Those, statements(functions) that we cannot prove(test) false after much effort, we deem to be true enough for our purposes.
- "Testing shows the presence not the absence, of bugs" -Edsger Wybe Dijkstra
- A program is falsifiable(testable) only if it was provable, but the usage of unrestrained *goto* statements prevents it from being provable, that's why *goto* got extinct and got replaced with the diciplined approach of control structures (Structured Programming).
